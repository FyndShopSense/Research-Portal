### Organization:

### Description: 
The act of research sets the course for the development of any product or service. Without comprehensive research, all stages that follow in research activities could be greatly affected. Finding the required information for research can be difficult as the resources and information on internet and otherwise are often located in dispersed places, and accessing the right content can be time consuming. In this context, a single State research portal is needed to be designed in a manner that it can serve as a one-stop research portal for all the State Universities and colleges comprising the essential areas/parameters. 

Few of the areas to be incorporated are as given below: 

a. Navigating to information: It should be built on user experience best practices. As researchers are used to accessing websites (whether in their personal or professional lives) that respond to their screen size and are optimized for mobile, but also contain ideal user experience elements to make it easy to navigate (think single search bar front and center, clear organization of content etc.). 

b. Uploading research, discovery of and access to information: It should be a user-friendly research portal wherein the researchers can search and discover the right information and content for their work. They also be able to upload their research work university/college/miscellaneous wise which may further be categorized department/areas of study wise. A discovery service is the next tool to consider integrating into research portal. Consider how metadata is used, the methodology around searching and retrieving search results, how the tool anticipates usersâ€™ needs, and what can be integrated into the discovery tool. 

c. Authentication: As research and collection of information resources become increasingly digital, authentication will be a key component to ensure the security of users and their content. For example, your collection may offer users access to various publisher or research platforms/portals that all have varying requirements for authentication. Entry into these resources is expected to be seamless and intuitive by researchers.
